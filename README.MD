## What it is? 

It is a well managed repository, using which one can integrate PayU in their GoLang Website in quick simple steps once they get PayU Merchant Key from PayU official website.

## Prerequisite

1. Create a merchant account in PayU.
2. Get PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY  which will be get once the onboarding process is completed.

## Steps to Follow

1. Set Up Merchant Key got from above process
  
  Provide the value for PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY in .env file
  
  ```
  #PayU Payment sandbox details
  merchant_key_stage = "XXXXXXXXX"
  merchant_salt_stage = "XXXXXXX"
  redirect_url_stage = `https://test.payu.in/_payment`

  #PayU Payment Production details
  merchant_key = "XXXXXXXXX"
  merchant_salt = "XXXXXXXX"
  redirect_url = `https://secure.payu.in/_payment`

  PAYMENT_MIDDLEWARE_URL = `http://localhost/payu.php`
  
  ```  

2. Verify Checksum Hash for successful transactions.

  A checksum hash is generated by the payu which is verified on merchant server for successful transaction. For this there is a file payu.go which need to be copied to your local as it works for generation and verification of checksum.

3. Set Mode

  PayU integration can be done in two stages i.e. staging and production modes have different PayU transaction urls.

  1. In staging mode we are using sandbox details for testing the payU working
  
  ```
   Staging mode transaction url 
   https://test.payu.in/_payment
  ```

  2. If you are using production mode means it accepts original details of payU

  ```
   Production mode transaction url    
   https://secure.payu.in/_payment
  ```
